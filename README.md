# Lattice Boltzmann model
## Structure
*Execute_simulation.ipynb*: *MAIN FILE*
 Contains the setup of the simulation, this function should be run if a 
simulation is needed to be performed. 

*Boltzmann_simulation.py*: 
Contains the simulation functions of the boltmann lattice.

*data_processing.py*:
Contains simple plotting functions.

*functions.py*:
Contains functions concerning steps in the simulation of the system.

*intialisation.py*:
Contains initialisaton functions, checking input en declaring arrays.
