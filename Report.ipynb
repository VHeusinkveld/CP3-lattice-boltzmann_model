    "In the model only densities of particles, $n_i$, and velocity, $v_i$, with a certain direction are taken into account. These directions correspond to the vectors labeled i making up the lattice. In this case a 9 vector lattice is used called the d2q9 lattice looking like so (Thijssen 2007): \n",

    "## The simulation \n",
    "### The setup\n",
    "For the geometry a 2D 'pipe' is defined, to which a square obstruction can be added, which will be centered in the pipe. Then the lattice vectors are defined, including a relation between the lattice vector and it's inverse. This is later need to incorporate the boundary conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the parameters, $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$ are set to 1 to simplify relations. Appart from that the maximum number of simulation iterations can be set afer which the simulation is stopped. Also the viscosity can be set, this should be done in such a way that the relaxation time, $\\tau$, is bigger then 1. This is such that the system does not relax faster then the minimal time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of the algorithm\n",
    "The simulation is initialised such that the density everywhere equals 1 expect for on the boundaries and in the object. Then a velocity forcing in applied, after which the equilibrium distribution, $n_{eq}$, is determined for every lattice point.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, the algorithm described above is implemented. For the tranlation of the densities, `numpy.roll()` is used in combination with the lattice vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary condition works as follows; if the density corresponding to vector `[1,0]` crosses the right boundary, the density gets transferred to the `[-1,0]` vector, such that the next time step the density returns to the pipe domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the code is implemented straightforwardly. \n"
