    "In the model, only densities of particles, $n_i$, and velocity, $v_i$, with a certain direction are taken into account. These directions correspond to the vectors labeled I making up the lattice. In this case, a 9 vector lattice is used called the d2q9 lattice as shown in the figure below (Thijssen 2007): \n",

    "\n",
    "### The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works as follows (based on Thijssen 2007):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The densities $n_i$ are moved to the appropriate neighbour according to the direction of the lattice vectors.\n",
    "- The velocities are calulated at each point and are weighted according to their respective density.\n",
    "- If the velocities pass over the boundaries they should be reversed.\n",
    "- A small velocity is added in the flow direction to simulate a pressure gradient. \n",
    "- The equilibrium distribution is calulated according to formula 14.34 of Thijssen 2007.\n",
    "- The densites are relaxed at each point according to: $n_i^{new} = (1-1/\\tau)n_i^{old} + n^{eq}_i/\\tau$. In which $\\tau$ is the relaxation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usefull relations \n",
    "\n",
    "The relation between the viscocity and the relaxation time is given by: $\\nu = \\frac{2\\tau - 1}{6}\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{\\Delta t}$. (Thijssen 2007)\n",
    "\n",
    "The curvature of the velocity of the flow should be $\\nabla P/\\rho v$. In which $\\nabla P$ can be related to the velocity addition in the flow direction via: $ \\nabla P = c\\rho\\Delta v $. (Thijssen 2007)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reynolds number is calculated by:\n",
    "$\\text{Re} = \\frac{uW}{\\nu}$ in which u is the mean velocity in the pipe along the flow direction, $W$ is the width of the pipe and $\\nu$ is the viscosity of the fluid.\n",

    "### The setup\n",
    "For the geometry a 2D 'torus-pipe' is defined, in which a square or circular obstruction can be placed, which will be centered at $\\left( 0.5W, 0.25L \\right)$ in the pipe. (It is called a 'torus-pipe' as the outflow is given as inflow to the 2D pipe.) Then the lattice vectors are defined, including a relationship between the lattice vector and its inverse (version in opposite direction). This is needed in a later stadium to incorporate the boundary conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the parameters, $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$ are set to 1 to simplify the relations. The maximum number of simulation iterations and the viscosity can be set to the desired value. The viscosity should be defined such that the relaxation time, $\\tau$, is bigger than 1. This is to ensure that the system does not relax faster than the minimal time step, $\\Delta t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of the algorithm\n",
    "The simulation is initialized such that the density everywhere equals 1 except for the boundaries and in the obstruction, at which it is set to 0. Then a velocity forcing in applied (due to the pressure gradient), after which the equilibrium distribution, $n_{eq}$, is determined for every lattice point.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, the algorithm described above is implemented. For the translation of the densities, `numpy.roll()` is used in combination with the lattice vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary condition has the following working principle:\n",
    "If the density corresponding to vector `[1,0]` crosses the right boundary, the density gets transferred to the `[-1,0]` vector, such that the next time step the density returns to the pipe domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the code is implemented straightforwardly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The equilibrium stage\n",
    "The simulation for the 2D 'torus-pipe' is stopped by the simulation once a global equilibrium has been reached. This equilibrium is based on the velocity in both x and y-direction in the geometry. Once the velocity in every grid point of the geometry does not change much with respect to the previous iteration $(v_i - v_{i-1} < \\epsilon)$, the simulation is regarded to be in equilibrium and is therefore ended. $\\epsilon$ is set to 0.001 which is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the flow velocity through the pipe (in the y-direction). The maximum amount of iterations is set to 1000."

The Reynolds number in the pipe is between 14 and 17 for the results shown below. Animations have been made as well. The diameter of the obstructions in the animations is 32.

Although the simulation is stopped after 344 iterations, because the velocity after 1 iteration is then below the errormargin, a weird oscillation in the velocity is seen. This is also visibile in the animations. As this is not seen for the case with an obstruction in the flow, we suspect that this arises form the initial, zero boundary conditions, creating standing waves in our plots. For the flow with obstruction these waves are interupted and thus don't occur.\n",

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the code seems to work, but shows an unexpected oscilation in the velocity-profile of the flow in the 2D 'torus-pipe' without an obstruction in the flow. The origin of this behaviour is still not certain and requires further investigation. Some suggestion to improve the simulations are to implement different boundary conditions, in the flow direction, such that the outlflow does not equal the inflow of the pipe. Also the determinitation of the equilibrium state now happens by comparing the previous to the current state, it would be better if it is compared to a couple of states before the current state. "

Unfortunately we don't have an explanation for this, other then that for some settings the simulated flow does not behave fully laminar. The figure shown below is for a system size of L=60, W=2.\n",

It can be seen that after an initial period of added velocities in the flow direction, equilibrium is reached and kinetic energy is conserved. This equilibrium optically seems to be earlier reached than for the plot above due to the quadratic scaling of kinetic energy with velocity. Hence it should arrive at the same time in equilibrium as the speed plot. The start of the plot is due to the initial conditions.\n",

    "This time collaboration proved to be a bit harder due to increased load from other courses. This meant that Vincent had a bit more time at the start, while Tom in the later parts of the project. We solved this by letting one be more concerned with the setup of the code and the other by checking and optimizing the code. The project itself was, compared to the others, more difficult for us, due to several bugs we encountered (for example the weights in the equilibrium distribution formula as discussed in the text). In the end, we managed to solve most of them, although some behavior is still unexplained. For the next project, a takeaway is to be both more involved at the start. Such to set out the code structure together since this makes errors less likely to happen and leads to more logical and readable code.    \n",
